# Chromium runs the GPU and renderer processes in an AppContainer, and those
# children still have to read the app's own files out of $INSTDIR. A per-user
# install under %LocalAppData%\Programs inherits no ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION
# PACKAGES entry, which is normally harmless, but on machines carrying explicit
# AppContainer/capability ACEs on the profile (agent sandboxes, MSIX leftovers)
# the children abort during early startup with STATUS_BREAKPOINT (0x80000003),
# before any GPU code runs. That kills the app outright through the GPU process
# and leaves a permanently blank window through the renderer. Granting
# read/execute to S-1-15-2-2 on our own install directory fixes it with both
# Chromium sandboxes left enabled. See issue #487 and electron/electron#51761.
#
# Microsoft documents this exact grant for unpackaged Win32 apps shipping the
# fixed-version WebView2 runtime, for the same reason: a renderer moved into an
# App Container can no longer read the app's own files. They pair it with
# S-1-15-2-1 (ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES); we deliberately do not. Chromium runs
# these children as LPAC, where that SID is replaced by S-1-15-2-2, and #487's
# A/B confirmed S-1-15-2-2 on its own clears both the GPU and renderer crash.
#
# Three details are deliberate. The SID literal is used because the display name
# is localized and would not resolve on a non-English Windows. /grant is
# additive, never /grant:r, so no existing entry is replaced. And the exit code
# is logged rather than acted on, so an unusual or hardened DACL cannot fail an
# install over a startup workaround.
