// Windows-only: keep an always-on-top widget above the taskbar (#533).
//
// Two independent things push a topmost window behind Shell_TrayWnd, and they
// have to be fixed in this order:
//
//   1. Electron itself, for the `floating` z-order level — SetAlwaysOnTop and
//      every window activation re-run its own SetWindowPos(hwnd, taskbar).
//      floatingAlwaysOnTopLevel() in windowBehavior.js opts out of that set,
//      which is what makes re-asserting worth doing at all: before that, every
//      activation undid it again.
//   2. Windows, on its own. Handing activation to the taskbar raises
//      Shell_TrayWnd to the top of the topmost band. Nothing notifies us
//      directly: a window only gets WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED when *it* moves, not
//      when another window overtakes it.
//
// Measured on Windows, (2) fires whenever activation moves *to* the taskbar,
// from whichever window held it. Only one of those transitions reaches us as an
// event — the widget losing its own activation — so nudge() covers that one
// from the window's blur, re-asserting immediately and again over the next 800
// milliseconds, because the shell raises the taskbar a moment later and a single
// immediate call gets overtaken.
//
// Every other transition (app -> taskbar, with the widget never focused) is the
// flow the widget is actually parked there for, and it reaches us only through
// windowsForegroundHook.js, which turns any foreground change in the system
// into the same event-driven re-assert. Measured on Windows, an interval alone
// cannot replace it: polling always covers-then-restores, and shortening the
// interval only shortens the visible flicker.
//
// The interval stays on at the same rate either way. Measured on Windows, the
// hook fires on every switch with sub-millisecond latency, but the shell does
// not always raise the taskbar inside the window the follow-ups cover — going
// widget -> other app -> taskbar lands the raise later than that — and a
// slower interval turns exactly that case back into a visible flicker. One
// SetWindowPos per interval is cheap enough that trading it for an unproven
// optimisation is not worth doing twice. Everything here is opt-in
// behind `keepAboveTaskbar`: a permanent timer, a system-wide hook and the
// flicker of the fallback are not things to hand to everyone who pins a
// widget.
//
// The cost is contained by running only while the window actually overlaps the
// area the taskbar reserves: a widget inside the work area can never be covered
// by it, so nothing runs for anyone who has not dragged the widget onto the
// taskbar. moveTop() is SetWindowPos(HWND_TOP, SWP_NOACTIVATE), so re-asserting
// never steals focus or activates the widget.

const INTERVAL_MS = 250;
// The shell raises the taskbar somewhere after the event that announced the
// switch, so the immediate call is reliably overtaken. How far after depends on
// the flow: taskbar-to-app lands inside the first two, widget -> other app ->
// taskbar lands later, which is why these run past the point where the interval
// would otherwise be the one to pick it up.
